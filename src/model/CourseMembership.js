This role is generally given to those developing, teaching, or facilitating the class. Instructors may access a course that is unavailable to students. This role is customizable and may have different capabilities from what is documented here. | | BbFacilitator | The facilitator is an instructor like role. Facilitators are restricted versions of an instructor, in that they are able to deliver course instruction and administer all aspects of a pre-constructed course, but are not allowed to modify or alter the course. This role is customizable and may have different capabilities from what is documented here. | | TeachingAssistant | The teaching assistant role is that of a co-teacher. Teaching assistants are able to administer all areas of a course. Their only limitations are those imposed by the instructor or Blackboard administrator at your school. This role is customizable and may have different capabilities from what is documented here. | | CourseBuilder | Manages the course without having access to student grades. This role is customizable and may have different capabilities from what is documented here. | | Grader | Assists the instructor in the creation, management, delivery, and grading of items. This role is customizable and may have different capabilities from what is documented here. | | Student |  | | Guest | Has no access to the Control Panel. Areas within the course are made available to guests, but typically they can only view course materials; they do not have access to tests or assessments, and do not have permission to post on discussion boards.
